## Hi there! 
 ðŸ‘‹ I'm Prashant Pooboni, enthusiastic about exploring the frontiers of technology and embracing the paradigm shifts brought about by recent advancements in the world of IT. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has not only fueled my curiosity but also revolutionized the way I approach problem-solving and software development.

The transformative power of LLMs has led me to realize that the days of relying solely on traditional "if else" statements are numbered. In this dynamic landscape, where innovation is constant, embracing new methodologies is key to staying ahead. The AI field has broadened my horizons, offering a diverse array of tools and techniques that accelerate application development and unlock possibilities that were once unimaginable.

Feel free to delve into my GitHub repositories, where I embark on personal projects and share my journey of leveraging AI/LLM technologies to drive meaningful change. 
Here you can find simple code to start learning and building LLM applications
